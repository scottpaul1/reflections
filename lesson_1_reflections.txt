How did viewing a diff between two versions of a 
file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It allowed me to view only the pieces of code that is of interest.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make 
you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Easier to catch mistakes or back track to a better version.
It allows better collaboration and management of people's
work on one specific project.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved like in 
Google Docs does?

Allowes you to better organize your changes.  However it would be nice to continually save the draft
and have a manual commit once the changes are ready.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because many programming files are dependent on each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

The git log will show all the revisions of a file and the diff will
allow programmers to compare the differences between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make 
changes that could break something?

You can always restort back to the last working version.

Added the following lines to Git and config files to the home directory

git config --global core.editor "'/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -n -w"
git config --global push.default upstream
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

No idea??

Commands
git diff earlier newer commit
git clone
git checkout
git log
